#Create a program that will play the “cows and bulls” game with the user. The game works like this:

#Randomly generate a 4-digit number. 
#Ask the user to guess a 4-digit number. 
#For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a “cow”. 
#For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a “bull.” 
#Every time the user makes a guess, tell them how many “cows” and “bulls” they have. 
#Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over. 
#Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes throughout teh game and tell the user at the end.
