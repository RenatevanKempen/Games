# Zombie game explained

I love playing games! And I love reading fiction books! And now with Python I can actually create my own games!!
Nothing really fancy (yet ;-)), but starting to get somewhere. 
These zombie games are just a start and combine my passion for fiction as well as my passion for games.

Hope you will enjoy playing them. 
Let me know what you thought of them by sending me an [email](renate@baime.nl). 

Love to hear from you!

Kind regards,

Renate van Kempen
